## Introduction:
  To Observe is an interactive digital platform designed to work in collaboration with schools and educational institutions. It provides realistic simulations of day-to-day social and emotional challenges faced by students.
In these simulations, students take on the role of a character in a virtual storyline, making choices and facing consequences based on real-life scenarios. These modules cover topics often left out of traditional curriculumsâ€”like dealing with criticism, anxiety, jealousy, social media/virtual addiction, insecurity, relationships, and more.
Our aim is to bridge the growing gap between emotional awareness and digital literacy, helping students build real-life values while learning to navigate the complexities of the online world.
